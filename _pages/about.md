I am an Computer Vision Researcher and data scientist. My research combines behavioral economics and applied microeconomics, with a particular focus on self-control issues and bounded rationality. My work uses a combination of theory, surveys, and both field and lab experiments.

I hold a Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Berkeley and I was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. Prior to graduate school, I was a research assistant at the [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/) in Washington, DC. I hold a B.S. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and I was born and raised in Minneapolis, MN.

I have excellent training in causal inference and designing/analyzing experiments and surveys. I have conducted research in academia, and both the public and private sector, and have communicated research and public policy findings to parties with diverse backgrounds and technical expertise.
