# 👋 About Me

I am currently a PhD student in the School of Engineering and Computer Science at **Victoria University of Wellington** (since March 2025), supervised by [Bastiaan Kleijn](https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/bastiaan.kleijn) and [Felix Yan](https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/felix.yan). My research focuses on:

- **Diffusion models for speech enhancement**, especially under low-latency, real-time constraints.
- Broader interests in **signal processing**, **deep generative models**, and **computer vision applications**.

Prior to my PhD, I obtained a Master’s degree in Information and Communication Engineering from **Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)**, and a Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Engineering from **Xidian University**. I also worked as a Research Assistant in 2024 at SUSTech on deep learning-based image and video understanding.
